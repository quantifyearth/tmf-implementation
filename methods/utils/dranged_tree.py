"""
This file and associated classes represent a dimensional-ranged-tree, which is a name I made up.
The idea of a d-ranged tree is you can build it from a list of N-dimensional ranges,
and then query points for membership. It is like a k-d tree, but items can end up
clipped on both sides of a partition. This is a time-memory trade-off in favour of
quicker search times.

Ranges can be specified in absolute or relative terms. This also makes this structure easier to query than a k-d tree,
whilst also being 10x faster to query - the reason being, our ranges overlap a lot, so a structure that merges
those ranges together will be faster than a k-d tree which knows nothing about the overlapped structure.
